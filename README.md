# TacoHaven

## Code layout
The `Public/` directory contains HTML, Javascript, etc. to be served directly to
the user.

`Public/bundle.js` is minified Javascript, and is not edited directly. Instead,
it is generated automatically using Webpack from the `src/` directory.

`src/index.js` is the source code for the front-end Javascript. The other files
in the `src/` directory are generated automatically by Amplify.

The `amplify/` directory is initially generated by Amplify, and specifies how the
backend should work. `amplify/backend/api` describes the GraphQL API & database
structure. `amplify/backend/function` defines the Lambda function called to send
emails in response to booking requests.

Important files written in the `amplify/` directory:
`amplify/backend/api/tacohavenfinal/schema.graphql` actually specifies the GraphQL API & database schema.
`amplify/backend/function/tacohavenemail/src/index.js` contains the code to send emails.
